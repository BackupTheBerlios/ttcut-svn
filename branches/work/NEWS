ttcut-0.19.1 April/2007
-----------------------

* Fixed German Umlaut handling in video and audio file names
  (not shure that these fixes work correct with all locales,
   please send me a mail if you encounter problems with the
   German Umlaut handling and append a copy of the locale command
   output)
* Fixed the white character escaping in video and audio file names.
  The muxlist and the direct mux (mplex) option should now work
  fine with file- and directorienames containing white characters (spaces).
* Fixed wrong ascpect ratio display on open GOP's
* Fixed cropped text in the about dialog
* Added a copy of the GPL ver. 2 (see COPYING)
* Removed the Qt-3 support dependence in ttmpeg2. The whole project
  should now compile without any Qt-3 support libraries needs.
* TTMpeg2 get's a more nicer gui
