TTCut-Buglist (Known issues)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* While navigating by keyboard cursor keys it is possible to position the
  strem pointer before the first (after the last) frame. The result is an
  index out of bound exception and TTCut crashed
* The RAM consumption is very high. This isn't realy a bug. More it is the
  result of some arkward programming at the beginning of TTCut. This will be
  fixed in further releases ;-)
* The usage of Mpeg2Schnitt index files (idd-files) doesn't result in
  increased performance during video processing. This was although a result
  of arkward programming. I will fixed this in further releases.
* Under unknown cirumstances TTCut crashed while executing transcode and forces 
  the xserver to shut down
* Crash: 1) open small video with sound
         2) Do Preview
         3) open small video without sound
         4) Do Preview
         5) open large video
         6) add range to cutlist
         7) crash! -> TTListIndexException
  Remark: With latest Version of TTcut this bug should be fixed!
